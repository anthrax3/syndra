Thoughts on rearchitecting these files with my new understanding of L:

Okay, so a Model is no longer a set of graph-action pairs -- it's a set of sets
of graph-action pairs. Each graph-action pair represents one transition that
the state-of-the-chemical-system can take at any given time. The sets of sets
represent sets of possible transitions.

So I need to make a TransitionSystem object of some sort, and _that_'s the thing
that I find models on, and it consists of sets of graph, action pairs.

Predicate does not undergo any major rearchitecting, the basic predicates
stay the same. However, I need to implement the [[]] semantics in addition
to just the [] (atomic) semantics I have now.
