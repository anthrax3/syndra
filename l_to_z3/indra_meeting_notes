ActivityActivity implied by ActivityModification (at two sites) and two Phosphorylations (at each site)

Phosphorylation(MAP2K1, MAPK1, PhosphorylationThreonine, #)
Phosphorylation(MAP2K1, MAPK1, PhosphorylationTyrosine, #)
ActivityActivity(MAP2K1, Kinase, increases, MAPK1, Kinase)
ActivityModification(MAPK1, ['PhosphorylationThreonine', 'PhosphorylationTyrosine'], ['183', '185'], increases, Activity)


come out with most mechanistic set of statements
but preserve the information supporting those statements

e.g. if we hear A->B and B->C and A->C, discard A->C because
it's implied, but keep some sort of information saying that
A->B is supported by its implication (with B->C) of A->C
